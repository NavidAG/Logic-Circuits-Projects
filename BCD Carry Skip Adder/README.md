# BCD Carry Skip Adder
>A carry-skip adder (also known as a carry-bypass adder) is an adder implementation that improves on the delay of a ripple-carry adder with little effort compared to other adders. The improvement of the worst-case delay is achieved by using several carry-skip adders to form a block-carry-skip adder. [-Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry-skip_adder)

I implemented this using proteus.
